## Multi-country continuous lifestyle scales

### This reposity contains scripts to generate the nine lifestyle scales presented in Watowich et al. 2024 (in prep). These scales quantify different facets of lifestyle and urbanicity across two transitioning, subsistence-level populations. 

#### Please reference: Watowich MM, Arner AM, Wang S, John E, Kahumbu JC, Kinyua P, Lotuki F, Miano C, Ng KS, Tam KL, Gurven M, Kamau J, Lim YA, Martins D, Nejeru S, Venkataraman VV, Wallace IJ, Ayroles JF, Kraft TS, Lea AJ. The built environment is more predictive of cardiometabolic health than other aspects of lifestyle change in two rapidly transitioning Indigenous populations. In prep.
